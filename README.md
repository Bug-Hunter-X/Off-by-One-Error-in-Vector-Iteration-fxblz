This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a vector using a for loop. The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= v.size()` allows the loop to iterate one element beyond the valid range of indices for the vector.  Accessing an element at an invalid index results in undefined behavior, such as a program crash or incorrect output.  The solution file provides a corrected version.
